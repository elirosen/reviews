<tr><td align='right'>1176</td><td align='right'>4</td><td>Yes</td><td>Wasn't that happy with the results of the service provider. The technician was here in June. At that time I was told I needed maintenance on the  refrigerator. The price for the maintenance was estimated at $150, I didn't have $150 and wanted to further investigate the contract and contacting AHS. After being told by AHS that maintenance was no longer covered, I called the company back to reschedule  the maintenance on the  refrigerator.  The technician return and completed the maintenance on the refrigerator for the $150.   The technician explained  that the refrigerator should be running fine the next day. I checked the refrigerator the following morning and it still wasn't freezing. Being that I was  misinformed . I don't think it's fair that I had to pay $150 for maintenance. Waiting to hear back from your company.</td><td>2016-07-15</td></tr>
